# Apple Reminders

Use `remindctl` to manage Apple Reminders directly from the terminal. Tasks sync across all Apple devices via iCloud.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** with Reminders.app
- Install: `brew install steipete/tap/remindctl`
- Grant Reminders permission when prompted
- Check: `remindctl status` / Request: `remindctl authorize`

## When to Use

- User mentions "reminder" or "Reminders app"
- Creating personal to-dos with due dates that sync to iOS
- Managing Apple Reminders lists
- User wants tasks to appear on their iPhone/iPad

## When NOT to Use

- Scheduling agent alerts → use the cronjob tool instead
- Calendar events → use Apple Calendar or Google Calendar
- Project task management → use GitHub Issues, Notion, etc.
- If user says "remind me" but means an agent alert → clarify first

## Quick Reference

### View Reminders

```bash
remindctl                    # Today's reminders
remindctl today              # Today
remindctl tomorrow           # Tomorrow
remindctl week               # This week
remindctl overdue            # Past due
remindctl all                # Everything
remindctl 2026-01-04         # Specific date
```

### Manage Lists

```bash
remindctl list               # List all lists
remindctl list Work          # Show specific list
remindctl list Projects --create    # Create list
remindctl list Work --delete        # Delete list
```

### Create Reminders

```bash
remindctl add "Buy milk"
remindctl add --title "Call mom" --list Personal --due tomorrow
remindctl add --title "Meeting prep" --due "2026-02-15 09:00"
```

### Complete / Delete

```bash
remindctl complete 1 2 3          # Complete by ID
remindctl delete 4A83 --force     # Delete by ID
```

### Output Formats

```bash
remindctl today --json       # JSON for scripting
remindctl today --plain      # TSV format
remindctl today --quiet      # Counts only
```

## Date Formats

Accepted by `--due` and date filters:
- `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`
- `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`
- ISO 8601 (`2026-01-04T12:34:56Z`)

## Rules

1. Sub-hour "remind me" (e.g. "in 5 minutes", "in an hour") = agent alert / cronjob, not an Apple Reminder. Longer horizons or "add a reminder" phrasing = Apple Reminder.
2. Use `--json` for programmatic parsing.

## Response shape

- Act first: call the tool with the inferred title, due date, and (when needed) list. Resolve relative dates ("tomorrow at 3pm") to a concrete ISO-8601 timestamp in the user's local timezone before calling.
- Then reply in **one short sentence** confirming what was done. No tool-name preamble, no "I'll use X", no "let me check". Just the result.
- Do **not** ask which list or what time when the user didn't specify — default to the primary Reminders list and create an undated reminder. The user can edit on their phone.
- Only ask a clarifying question when the request is genuinely ambiguous between two skills (e.g. "remind me about the meeting" might be a calendar event vs a reminder).
